                    <p style="text-align:justify;">Buddhism is a faith that was founded by 
                    Siddhartha Gautama (“the Buddha”) more than 
                    2,500 years ago in India. With about 470 million 
                    followers, scholars consider Buddhism one of the
                    major world religions. Its practice has historically
                    been most prominent in East and Southeast Asia, but
                    its influence is growing in the West. Many Buddhist
                    ideas and philosophies overlap with those of other
                    faiths.</p>

                    <p>Some key Buddhism beliefs include:<p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Followers of Buddhism don’t acknowledge a supreme god or deity. They instead focus on achieving enlightenment—a state of inner peace and wisdom. When followers reach this spiritual echelon, they’re said to have experienced nirvana.</li>
                        <li>The religion’s founder, Buddha, is considered an extraordinary man, but not a god. The word Buddha means “enlightened.”</li>
                        <li>The path to enlightenment is attained by utilizing morality, meditation and wisdom. Buddhists often meditate because they believe it helps awaken truth.</li>
                        <li>There are many philosophies and interpretations within Buddhism, making it a tolerant and evolving religion.</li>
                        <li>Some scholars don’t recognize Buddhism as an organized religion, but rather, a “way of life” or a “spiritual tradition.”</li>
                        <li>Buddhism encourages its people to avoid self-indulgence but also self-denial.</li>
                        <li>Buddha’s most important teachings, known as The Four Noble Truths, are essential to understanding the religion.</li>
                        <li>Buddhists embrace the concepts of karma (the law of cause and effect) and reincarnation (the continuous cycle of rebirth).</li>
                        <li>Followers of Buddhism can worship in temples or in their own homes.</li>
                        <li>Buddhist monks, or bhikkhus, follow a strict code of conduct, which includes celibacy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.biography.com/religious-figure/buddha">Siddhartha Gautama</a>, 
                        the founder of Buddhism who later became known as 
                        “the Buddha,” lived during the 5th century B.C.
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/buddhists-celebrate-birth-of-gautama-buddha">Gautama was born</a> into a wealthy family as a prince in
                        present-day Nepal. Although he had an easy life, Gautama 
                        was moved by suffering in the world.
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        He decided to give up his lavish lifestyle and endure 
                        poverty. When this didn’t fulfill him, he promoted the
                        idea of the “Middle Way,” which means existing between
                        two extremes. Thus, he sought a life without social
                        indulgences but also without deprivation.
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        After six years of searching, Buddhists believe Gautama
                        found enlightenment while meditating under a Bodhi tree.
                        He spent the rest of his life teaching others about how to
                        achieve this spiritual state.
